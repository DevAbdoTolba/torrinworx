My name is Torrin Leonard. I'm the creator of the Blender add-ons Blend_My_NFTs and Cozy Auto Texture as well as the Co-Founder, CEO, lead Software Engineer and Web Developer at This Cozy Studio Inc.

I got started programming in 2020; I wanted to learn Python to create a universal scientific calculator that would traverse the formulas of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and all other fields of science. My goal was for it to function similar to the Scratch programming language and complete it in time for my first year as a Physics and Astronomy student at the University of Waterloo. I then started working at [League](https://league.com/ca/) through my family's business worX4you as an Automation, Accessibility, and QA Software Tester. I learned the importance of Accessibility in modern web development through my <a href="https://courses.edx.org/certificates/05d8dc2dc24e42238e616f83329ee2f0" rel="nofollow">WCAG certificate</a>. I also learned Node.js and the TestCafe module where I would run automated software tests in TypeScript for League and President's Choice web and mobile applications.

During 2021, I've learned the Blender Python API, how to manipulate the core functionality of Blender and create a UI system for users to interact with. I've written and documented it's functionality in an organized readme file, as well as created and updated several YouTube tutorials on how to use the software. I've also spent countless hours working with my team helping and engaging with members of our growing Discord and YouTube community.

During 2022 I learned a lot about business and finance to help our growing company. I've learned how to interact with clients, negotiate contracts, and handle the finances of our operations. I've also dipped my toes into the AWS suit of technologies by launching a couple Django apps with Lightsail, as well as setting up the Stable Diffusion model distribution for the Cozy Auto Texture Blender add-on using AWS S3 buckets. I've also learned to use AWS EC2 to advance our copmanies rendering capabilites for our clients using G4DN instances and other cloud GPU services such as iRender, PaperSpace, and Vagon. I plan on launching our sas website on AWS using the G4DN graphics card instances to handle the cloud rendering service we will provide. During 2022 I also experimented with the permanent storage solution Arweave; A blockchain technology that enables sustainable permanent storage for a reasonable fee. I've used tools such as Bundlr and the ArDrive API's to help clients store their NFT assets on Arweave forever.
